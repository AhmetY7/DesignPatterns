/**
 * Concrete Commands implement various kinds of requests. A concrete command isnâ€™t supposed to perform the work on
 * its own, but rather to pass the call to one of the business logic objects. However, for the sake of simplifying
 * the code, these classes can be merged.
 *
 * Parameters required to execute a method on a receiving object can be declared as fields in the concrete command.
 * You can make command objects immutable by only allowing the initialization of these fields via the constructor.
