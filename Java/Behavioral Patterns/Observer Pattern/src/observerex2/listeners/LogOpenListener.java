Concrete Subscribers perform some actions in response to notifications issued by the publisher. All of these classes
must implement the same interface so the publisher isnâ€™t coupled to concrete classes.

Usually, subscribers need some contextual information to handle the update correctly. For this reason, publishers
often pass some context data as arguments of the notification method. The publisher can pass itself as an argument,
letting subscriber fetch any required data directly.
