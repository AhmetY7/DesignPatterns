/**
 * Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.
 *
 * Use the Prototype pattern when your code shouldnâ€™t depend on the concrete classes of objects that you need to copy.
 *
 * Use the pattern when you want to reduce the number of subclasses that only differ in the way they initialize their respective objects.
 * Somebody could have created these subclasses to be able to create objects with a specific configuration.
